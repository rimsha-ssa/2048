## 1. DRY (Don’t repeat yourself)
> Our first object-oriented design principle is DRY, as the name suggests DRY (don’t repeat yourself) means don’t write duplicate code, instead use Abstraction to abstract common things in one place.


## 2. Open Closed Design Principle
>According to tho this OOP design principle, “Classes, methods or functions should be Open for extension (new functionality) and Closed for modification”.
>This is another beautiful SOLID design principle, coined by Uncle Bob on his classic Clean Code book, which prevents someone from changing already tried and tested code. The key benefit of this design principle is that already tried and tested code is not touched which means they won’t break.


## 3. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
>Single Responsibility Principle is another SOLID design principle, and represent “S” on the SOLID acronym. As per SRP, there should not be more than one reason for a class to change, or a class should always handle single functionality.
>The key benefit of this principle is that it reduces coupling between the individual component of the software and Code.


## 4. Composition > Inheritance
>The “composition over inheritance” principle states that objects with complex behaviors should do so by containing instances of objects with individual behaviors rather than inheriting a class and adding new behaviors.


## 5.YAGNI
>The “you aren’t gonna need it” principle is the idea that you should never code for functionality that you may need in the future.


## 6. Avoid Premature Optimization 
>Reach your milestones as simply as you can, then profile your code to identify true bottlenecks.


## 7. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
>According to the Liskov Substitution Principle, Subtypes must be substitutable for supertype I mean methods or functions which uses superclass type must be able to work with the object of subclass without any issue.


## 8. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
>Interface Segregation Principle states that, a client should not implement an interface if it doesn’t use that.


## 9 .Clean Code > Clever Code
>clean code is better than clever code.


## 10.KISS
The “keep it simple, stupid” principle.
